# ARemedy

## Introduction
A 3rd Year Undergraduate Project which is part of my Computing in Software Development course at Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology in Ireland. ARemedy is Augmented Reality application which will allow variety of users to leave messages, images, posters, important notifications or reminders behind. By behind, I mean at the actual/exact location where the user will be at any given time. 

The application will allow for broad use of the application, you'd only be limited by your own creativity. For example you could add some paintings, notice boards, posters to boring plain walls of your room. But not only in your room, application would allow for users to do it anywhere. No matter of the location. Are you a lecturer in the college? You need to let your students know that the venue of the lecture was moved to another room? This could be a way to leave a note on the door for your students to find check it.

ARremedy could provide simple, creative yet unique way of making things possible and much more, all withing a grasp of your hand. It could already be in your hand. All you need would be a device with a camera, capable of taking picture.
